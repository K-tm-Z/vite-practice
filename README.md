- Realized that I've been doing things very randomly (resulted from learning with AI and random youtube tutorials) so I decided to dedicate this next update just to learn and practice/ playing around with CSS flexbox.
- Utilized flexbox layout
- Mimicked banners' behaviours, tried to create the content list.

- Used contrasting colors for accessibilities for now.
- Revamped the Navbar:
    - Changed the layout to better visualize the components
    - Made the navbar stuck to the top
    - Added visual aid for button hovering
    - Lorem Ipsum-ish the site to test out the sticky nav function
- Remove a few default properties and values:
    - Vite starter kit forced the body of the app to a flex display, making it contorted into a narrow column
